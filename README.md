Reproducible jupyter notebooks in R language to replicate the main figures of the manuscript under review at Water Resources Research entitled "Spatio-temporal patterns and drivers of high-impact precipitation events in the European Alps (1961–2022)"

- **Fig1**: Overview of the 1,010 High-Impact Precipitation Events (HIPEs) detected across the Alps for the period 1961–2022. 
- **Fig2**: Spatial patterns of seasonal HIPE regimes and total number of unique daily HIPEs (i.e., non-concatenated) across the Alps, 1961–2022.
- **Fig3**: Partial   dependence plots showing the marginal effect of each predictor on the probability of daily HIPE occurrence, based on a Generalized Additive Model (GAM).   
- **Fig4**: Seasonal distribution of HIPEs grouped by overall magnitude (M) and association to flood characteristics over 1961-2022.  
- **Fig5-6**: Synoptic environments associated with the four most frequent Weather Types (WTs) linked to HIPEs in the Alpine region.
- **Fig7**: Spatial distribution and impact relevance of dominant WTs associated with HIPEs in the Alps
- **Fig8**: Total accumulated precipitation (mm) associated with the top 10  HIPEs detected in the Alpine region during 1961–2022.
